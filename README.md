# SynapticBlox.jl

This is a Neuroblox project providing neurons and cortical structures where synapses are no longer stored inside presynaptic neurons. The main motiviation is to allow the modular represntation of different receptor types, and to have synaptic details be able to depend on the particular connection betweeneurons, rather than only depend on the presynaptic neuron.

This work is currently unstable and subject to rapid change.
